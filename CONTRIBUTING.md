# Contributing to Sovereign Stack

## Current Status

The Sovereign Stack is in **active research and development**. Core governance primitives are architecturally stable, but implementation substrates vary by deployment context.

## Before Contributing

**For researchers**: Open issues for theoretical questions or methodology discussion.

**For implementers**: Contact maintainers before submitting code—substrate-specific implementations require coordination.

**For organizations**: Schedule a governance scoping call to discuss co-design partnerships.

We welcome collaboration but ask that substantial changes be discussed before submission to ensure architectural coherence.
