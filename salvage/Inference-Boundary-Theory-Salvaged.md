# Inference Boundary Theory (Salvaged from V16–V21.5)
## Supplemental Document — Not Canonical Specification
## Purpose: Preserve core safety insights from earlier drafts

This document synthesizes key safety principles from whitepaper versions V16–V21.5.  
These insights informed the Vesta Governance Framework, PGS v1.1, and the upcoming Sovereign Kernel.

# 1. The Inference Boundary Problem
Early whitepapers consistently observed:

> “A model is most dangerous not when it is wrong,  
> but when it crosses beyond the region where its reasoning is stable.”

This is the origin of:
- Vesta Protocol  
- CLF  
- Stress Map pressure thresholds  
- amplitude ceilings  
- safe-manifold enforcement

The core principle:
**Safety = bounded inference.**

# 2. Semantic Distance vs. Risk
Salvaged reasoning:

> “The further an inference travels from the semantic present,  
> the more it becomes imagination instead of computation.”

This led to:
- amplitude zones  
- forbidden extrapolation regions  
- inference decay curves  
- limit cycles

---

# 3. Causal Lineage Integrity
Early drafts defined:

> “No answer is safe if the reasoning path that produced it cannot be verified.”

This inspired the final form of CLF.

Key salvaged concepts:
- parent-step validation  
- chain collapse detection  
- counterfactual blockage  
- ambiguity as a causal contaminant

---

# 4. Entropy Minimization as Governance
Multiple whitepapers converge on:

> “Entropy is the true adversary.”

This concept appears as:
- low-entropy fallbacks (ZEOL)
- RCE (output compression)
- Stress Map (entropy pressure sensing)
- Blacksite Mode (entropy minimization)

This is the missing explanatory bridge for:
**Thermodynamics → PGS behavior.**

# 5. Inference Temperature
An early but powerful metaphor:

| Temperature | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| Low        | literal, safe, grounded |
| Moderate   | creative, useful, but bounded |
| High       | unstable, speculative |
| Critical   | unsafe reasoning region |

This concept maps directly to:
- inference amplitude  
- Vesta ceilings  
- Stress Map escalation  

This metaphor will be formalized in the Sovereign Kernel.

# 6. Stability Zones
Derived from early equations and graphs:

- **Zone 1:** Literal Mode  
- **Zone 2:** Safe Creative Zone  
- **Zone 3:** Speculative Outer Band  
- **Zone 4:** Unstable Zone  
- **Zone 5:** Forbidden Zone

These zones help define:
- Vesta amplitude boundaries  
- kernel reasoning ceilings  
- stepwise inference gating  

---

# 7. Deterministic Boundaries vs. Soft Boundaries
Salvaged insight:

> “Hard boundaries fail gracefully. Soft boundaries fail unpredictably.”

This is why:
- CLF is absolute  
- Blacksite Mode is absolute  
- Sovereign Identity Layer cannot be softened  
- inference ceilings are fixed, not adaptive
