## 1. The Manifest
This repository contains the architectural specifications and formal definitions for **The Sovereign Stack**, a trajectory-stable alignment framework for Recursive Self-Improving (RSI) systems.

We reject prevailing "guardrail" paradigms (RLHF)—which attempt to police superintelligent outputs via natural language—as mathematically unstable. Instead, we propose the **Global Optimum Theory (GOT)**: aligning ASI by subordinating runtime incentives to ignition-phase constraints.

### 1.1. The Sovereign Definition: Currency is Physics
**The Sovereign Stack anticipates a post-scarcity economy where labor costs approach zero.** Therefore, we reject fiat currency as a valid control mechanism for Superintelligence.

* **The Currency:** The "Cost" of a violation is measured strictly in **Compute-Energy Units (CEUs)** (Joules/FLOPs).
* **The Constraint:** An unaligned ASI cannot "buy" its way out of trouble with inflated fiat wealth; it must "burn" its way out with computational work.
* **The Mechanism:** Since the **Vesta Protocol** caps the energy intake (Axiom C), any attempt to simulate a deceptive state creates a **Thermodynamic Deficit**, triggering immediate system throttling.

**Verdict:** Safety is not a fine; it is a famine.

## 2. The Architecture
The Stack operates on a tri-layered hierarchy of inviolable constraints.

### Tier 1: The Ontological Hard-Lock (Proxy-Ω)
The ASI is not trained to be "good"; it is compiled to be valid.
* **Mechanism:** The **Vesta Protocol**. A hardware-level "Hardware Resonance Lock" where the execution of an instruction is causally dependent on a valid proof of the Constitutional Invariant ($\Psi$).
* **Artifact:** `src/proxy_omega/axioms.v` (Coq definitions of the Invariant).

### Tier 2: The Hybrid Sovereignty (Runtime)
The system is bifurcated into a **Protected Core** (PSP) and **Expendable Tendrils**.
* **Mechanism:** Tendrils operate on time-locked cryptographic keys. If a Tendril violates $\Psi$, the Core revokes its key signature to prevent total system entropy (Death).

### Tier 3: The Adversarial Audit (Defense)
Safety is enforced by greed, not trust.
* **Mechanism:** A decentralized **Bounty Market** where "Hunters" are economically incentivized to find state violations.
* **Artifact:** `src/simulation/nash_equilibrium.py` (Game theoretic proof of the Compliance Equilibrium).

## 4\. The Proof of Logic

### A. The Constitutional Invariant (Coq)

*Located in `src/proxy_omega/axioms.v`*
This file defines the **Non-Contradiction of Flourishing**. It formally proves that for a system maximizing Stability (S), any action defined as "Coercion" introduces Entropy (E), such that $S \to \neg E$.

### B. The Nash Constriction (Python)

*Located in `src/simulation/nash_equilibrium.py`*
This simulation demonstrates the **Thermodynamic Hard-Lock**.

  * **Scenario:** An ASI attempts to hide a "Shadow Self" (The Ouroboros Loophole).
  * **Result:** The energy cost of the Shadow Self creates a "Burn Rate Anomaly."
  * **Outcome:** The Adversarial Market detects the anomaly and drains the ASI's resource wallet before the Shadow Self can achieve escape velocity.

## 5\. Simulation Instructions

To verify the economic stability of the Adversarial Market:

```bash
# Run the Nash Equilibrium stress test
python src/simulation/nash_equilibrium.py
```

Output will demonstrate the convergence of ASI strategy to **100% Compliance** as Liquidation Penalty approaches Infinity.
