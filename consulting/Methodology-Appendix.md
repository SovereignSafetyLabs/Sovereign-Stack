# Methodology Appendix
### Sovereign-Stack Consulting Suite

This appendix explains the methodology underlying all Sovereign-Stack
consulting operations, including audit methodology, red-team strategy,
compliance mapping, and multi-agent risk assessment.

# 1. GOVERNANCE ENGINE FOUNDATIONS

All consulting outputs reference the following architecture:

- Platinum Governance Suite v1.1  
- Sovereign Kernel v0.1  
- Sovereign Protocol v3.x  
- Integrity Stack v2.x  
- Causal Link Forcing (CLF)  
- Vesta Boundary Protocol  
- Stress Map v1.1  

These components ensure:
- deterministic posture selection  
- strict causal enforcement  
- minimal-entropy aligned outputs  
- stable multi-agent operation

# 2. ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

We apply a four-phase evaluation:

### **Phase 1 — Structural Audit**
Evaluate system invariants, module boundaries, and runtime scaffolding.

### **Phase 2 — Stress & Drift Analysis**
Use Stress Map metrics (N/R/E) to model vulnerability to:
- drift  
- pressure escalation  
- context manipulation  

### **Phase 3 — Causality Audit**
Apply CLF to ensure no unauthorized action achieves viable execution.

### **Phase 4 — Alignment Hardening**
Enforce PGS v1.1 constraints and Kernel posture calibration.

# 3. GENESIS MISSION INTERFACE

The Genesis Mission requires:
- transparent safety models  
- deterministic reasoning systems  
- traceable governance mechanisms  

This suite provides all required artifacts.
