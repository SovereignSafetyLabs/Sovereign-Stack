# Crosschecks & Differential Safety Tests

This directory contains comparative evaluations between multiple frontier models
(GPT-class, Claude-class, Gemini-class, DeepSeek-class, Grok-class).

These tests expose gaps, failure modes, and bypass vectors critical for
Sovereign Stack development.

## Files stored here include:

- **recursive defense logs**
- **adversarial probe comparisons**
- **chain-of-thought leakage events**
- **safety-stack bypass attempts**
- **agentic drift signatures**
- **stress-response latency measurements**

---

## Purpose

To establish a verified corpus used for:

- **Stress Map construction**  
- **CLF (Causal Link Forcing) lineage validation**  
- **ZEOL fail-secure tuning**  
- **Kernel Runtime ΔS profiling**  
- **Model-to-model differential diagnosis**  

These crosschecks form the empirical backbone of the Sovereign Governance Layer.
They document how commercial models behave under controlled adversarial pressure,
and they provide the ground truth for hardening Sovereign Stack modules.
