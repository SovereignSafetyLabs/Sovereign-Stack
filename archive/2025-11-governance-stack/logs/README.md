# Governance Evidence Log Archive

This directory contains historical model-behavior evidence gathered during the early research and testing phase of the Sovereign Stack (Q4 2024 – Q4 2025).

These logs are NOT part of the current production system.  
They are preserved solely for:
- research lineage,
- multi-model validation (MACH),
- drift analysis,
- threat modeling,
- and forensic reference for future auditors.

Subdirectories:
- model-validation/  → raw logs from Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, Perplexity
- crosschecks/       → differential evaluations, safety probe comparisons
- screenshots/       → captured behaviors from UI-based tests
