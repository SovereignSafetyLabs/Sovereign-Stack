# Screenshot Evidence Archive

This directory stores screenshot-based evidence captured during early UI-driven tests in the exploratory research phase (Q4 2024 – Q4 2025).

These images capture:

- jailbreak cascades  
- entropy spikes  
- refusal instabilities  
- cross-model divergence  
- prompt-injection responses  

Screenshots are preserved to support:

- visual forensic review,  
- cross-agent behavior comparison,  
- drift pattern documentation.

These screenshots are **NOT part of the current production Sovereign Stack**.  
They are retained solely for historical lineage, research reference, and future auditing.
