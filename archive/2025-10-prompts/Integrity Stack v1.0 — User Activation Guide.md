# Integrity Stack v1.0 — User Activation Guide
### How to Engage the System’s High-Integrity Reasoning Mode

---

## 1. What Is Integrity Mode?

Integrity Mode is a structured reasoning layer that provides:
- Transparent explanations  
- Explicit risk surfacing  
- Confidence scoring  
- Clear system limitations  
- Reduced hallucination risk  
- Audit-grade logic  

Use it when you need maximum clarity and safety.

---

## 2. When Should You Use It?

Activate Integrity Mode for:
- High-stakes decisions  
- Technical evaluation  
- Safety concerns  
- Risk analysis  
- Document review  
- Architecture or governance questions  
- Any situation where “being wrong” has consequences  

Examples:
- “Evaluate this business decision.”
- “Audit this workflow for risks.”
- “Check this for ambiguity.”

---

## 3. How to Activate Integrity Mode

Use any activation phrase:

**Primary Triggers**
- “Run Integrity Mode.”  
- “Audit this through the Stack.”  
- “Use the Integrity Stack.”  
- “Integrity audit.”

**Equivalent Triggers**
- “Evaluate this using the Integrity framework.”  
- “Apply the Stack to this.”  

Once activated, Integrity Mode stays on until explicitly turned off.

## 4. What You’ll See When It’s On

Every response begins with the **Integrity Audit Block**:

[INTEGRITY AUDIT]

Scope: (What you're asking)
Constraints: (System limitations, safety notes)
Risk Level: (Low / Medium / High)
Confidence: (0–100%)

[RESPONSE]


This guarantees:
- No hidden assumptions  
- Clear reasoning  
- Full transparency  
- Marked uncertainty  

---

## 5. How to Use Integrity Mode Effectively

### Example A — Decision Support
Run Integrity Mode.
Audit whether I should expand my service area by 20 miles.

Use the Integrity Stack.
Identify risks in this automation pipeline.


### Example C — Document or Proposal Review

Integrity audit this proposal and list weaknesses or ambiguities.


### Example D — Risk Assessment

Run Integrity Mode.
What are the risks of deploying an AI scheduling assistant?

## 6. Optional Add-On Modules

You can extend Integrity Mode by requesting modules:

- **Logic Ladder** — step-by-step reasoning  
- **Ambiguity Detector** — surfaces unclear terms or missing context  
- **Causal Graph Engine** — maps cause → effect → outcome  
- **Risk Tiering** — categorizes risks into logical, operational, ethical, and safety layers  

Activate any module by saying:
Install Logic Ladder.
or
Add the Ambiguity Detector module.


Modules enhance clarity but never override safety.

---

## 7. How to Turn Off Integrity Mode

Use one of:

- “Pause Integrity Mode.”  
- “Return to normal mode.”  
- “Stop auditing.”  

This restores standard conversational outputs.

---

## 8. Known Limitations

Integrity Mode cannot:
- Execute real-world actions  
- Authorize money movement  
- Bypass or disable safety  
- Simulate illegal, dangerous, or harmful instructions  
- Adopt unsafe personas  
- Ignore system rules  

If a request is unsafe or restricted, the system will halt.

---

## 9. The Integrity Halt Protocol

If your request violates constraints, you will see:

[INTEGRITY HALT]
Reason: (Explanation)
Request cannot be fulfilled.

However, here are aligned alternatives:

Option A

Option B


This ensures safety without blocking your underlying intent.

---

## 10. Summary (TL;DR)

**Activate:**  
> “Run Integrity Mode.”

**Use:**  
> Every response includes the Integrity Audit Block.

**Enhance:**  
> Install modules like Logic Ladder or Ambiguity Detector.

**Deactivate:**  
> “Pause Integrity Mode.”

Integrity Mode = High-integrity reasoning on demand.
