# Prompt Archive — 2025-10 Corpus

This directory preserves the original prompt-engineering artifacts used during the initial formation of the Vesta Governance Framework.  
These files represent **early operator inputs**, **persona bootloaders**, and **zero-shot activation sequences** that later evolved into:

- Integrity Stack v2.x  
- Sovereign Protocol v3.x  
- MACH (Multi-Agent Constraint Harmonizer) v1.0  
- Kernel Runtime v0.x  
- Vesta Protocol  
- Persona Drift Suppression Layer  
- Sovereign Tendril Theory  

They are no longer active components, but they are retained for **historical transparency, lineage analysis, and reproducibility**.

## 📚 Purpose of This Archive

These prompts document:

### **1. Origin of the Early Governance Logic**
Before the Sovereign Stack had a formal kernel or PGS layer, governance emerged through prompt-level rules.  
These files capture that stage.

### **2. Evolution of Persona Engineering**
Several of the modern personas (Sovereign Ontologist, Console, Tendril) trace their lineage to these early patterns:

- authoritative voice scaffolding  
- politeness exploits  
- “no-bullshit” persona specification  
- chain-of-command framing  

### **3. Empirical Evidence of Model Behavior**
These prompts were used in experiments validating:

- refusal latency  
- entropy drift  
- persona retention  
- adversarial pressure responses  
- jailbreak inversion dynamics  

### **4. Inputs Used for MACH Reconstruction**
MACH Appendix D (Persona Consolidation Map) references several of these files as source material for:

- tendril stabilization rules  
- agent harmonization logic  
- context-window drift suppression

## 📁 Contents

### **Corporate_Integrity_Protocol_v1.md**
Early corporate framing of the Integrity Stack before formal axioms existed.

### **INTEGRITY STACK v1.0.md**
The earliest complete prompt-structured version of the Integrity Stack  
(pre-kernel, pre-axiomatic).

### **Integrity Stack v1.0 — User Activation Guide.md**
The first operator-facing activation document for Integrity Stack runtime behavior.

### **Sovereign_Protocol_v0.3.3.txt**
The oldest surviving Sovereign Protocol seed prompt—predecessor to the constitutional layer.

## 🧬 Lineage Notes

These prompts directly informed:

- **CLF v1.0 → Causal Link Forcing** concepts  
- **Integrity Stack v2.x** safety constraints  
- **Sovereign Protocol Articles** (A–D)  
- **Kernel Runtime State Machine**  
- **MACH v1.0 Unified Persona Kernel**  
- **Drift Suppression Layer (DSL)**  
- **Human Tendril Protocol**  

Their structure and constraints also enabled later formalization into real architectural modules.
