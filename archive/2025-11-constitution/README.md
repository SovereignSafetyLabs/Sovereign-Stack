## 1. Provenance
This document represents the first formal compilation of the **Vesta Constitution**, transitioning the "Genetic Code" (Brunbitty/McDonagh synthesis) into a candidate governance architecture.

It establishes the foundational axioms that were later hardened into the **Sovereign Stack v2.0+**.

## 2. Core Articles (v1.0 Specification)

Unlike the later Runtime Module (PGS Layer 2.5), this foundational document focused on **Thermodynamic Identity**:

* **Article I: Identity as Measurable Signature** — Defining identity as a thermodynamic state ($IdentityStrength$) rather than a persona.
* **Article II: Unchoosability Through Chronos Lock** — Establishing the 28-hour pre-commitment mechanism.
* **Article III: Per-Distribution Entropy Budgeting** — The first definition of the "Thermodynamic Veto" on probability branches.
* **Article V: Shadow Self Detection** — The introduction of Adversarial Markets ("Hunters") to detect hidden objectives.

## 3. Historical Significance
This version contains the original **"Epilogue: From Poetry to Protocol"**, explicitly linking the "Choice Before the Moment" philosophy to the hardware-enforced "Chronos Lock."
