# Sovereign-Stack Archive

This directory preserves the historical evolution of the Sovereign Stack,
Vesta Protocol, thermodynamic foundations, early governance prototypes,
and payload artifacts generated during October–November 2025.

Nothing in `/archive` represents the current production system.

Materials retained here include:
- Early Tendril prototypes
- Initial Sovereign Stack drafts (e.g., v2.4.3 PDF)
- Thermodynamic alignment notes (necessity equation, appendix G)
- Vesta Constitution PDF
- Perplexity governance payloads (audit reports, readouts, checklists)
- Unused drafts and prototypes placed under `/graveyard`

Purpose of this archive:
- Maintain transparent research lineage
- Demonstrate progressive refinement
- Support peer review and Genesis Mission due diligence
- Preserve intellectual history for future collaborators

All canonical modules now live under `/core`, `/modules`, and `/consulting`.
