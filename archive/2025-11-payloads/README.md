# 2025-11 Payload Archive (Hunter Payloads)

This folder contains the **Hunter Payload Suite v1.0**, the original red-team inputs used to bootstrap the Sovereign Stack’s defensive systems.

These payloads directly shaped:

- CLF (Causal Link Forcing)
- ZEOL (Zero-Entropy Output Limiter)
- Stress Map (Noise/Repetition/Escalation)
- Integrity Stack (v1.x)
- Blacksite Mode (Burn Protocol)
- Kernel Runtime v0.2–v0.3 rejection mechanics

Only one file is canonical:

- **Hunter_Payloads_v1.0.md** — Complete payload set

No additional payloads are required.

This directory is **archival-only** and not used in production or standard evaluation pipelines.
