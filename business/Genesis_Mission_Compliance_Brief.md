# 1. Purpose

The Genesis Mission (Executive Order, Nov 2025) establishes a federal requirement for AI systems accessing HPC, scientific datasets, and national security workflows to demonstrate:

- deterministic safety  
- interoperability  
- auditability  
- cross-agent consistency  
- failure-mode containment  

The **Sovereign Stack** provides a governance and runtime architecture aligned with these requirements.

# 2. Relevant Sovereign Stack Mechanisms

## 2.1 Constitutional Layer (Sovereign Protocol v3.0 + v3.1)

Supports Genesis Mission objectives:

- **No privilege escalation**  
- **No self-modification**  
- **Deterministic refusal boundaries**  
- **Thermodynamic honesty enforcement** (ΔS ≤ 0)

This satisfies “uniform safety constraints across interoperable agents.”

---

## 2.2 Governance Layer (PGS v1.1)

PGS introduces:

- **Cross-Layer Telemetry Bus (CLTB)**  
- **Multi-Agent Constraint Harmonizer (MACH)**  
- **Zero-Entropy Override Layer (ZEOL)**  
- **Response Compression Engine (RCE)**  

These provide:

- consistent state reporting  
- predictable hardening under load  
- low-entropy outputs  
- cross-agent behavioral determinism  

This aligns with Genesis requirements for “harmonized agent governance.”

---

## 2.3 Runtime Layer (Kernel v0.2)

Provides:

- state machine control  
- semantic intent detection  
- risk posture assignment  
- telemetry integration  

Ensures that Genesis-compatible systems behave deterministically across:

- agents  
- contexts  
- datasets  

---

## 2.4 Thermodynamic Safety (Kernel v0.3)

Genesis Mission mandates prevention of:

- cascading failures  
- runaway inference  
- destabilizing simulation chains  

Kernel v0.3 enforces:

- ΔS trend detection  
- entropy spike detection  
- stability-zone enforcement  
- Proxy Valve stabilization  
- Blackstop catastrophic containment  

This satisfies the requirement for “fail-safe behavior under unpredictable stimuli.”

# 3. Compliance Mapping (High-Level)

| Genesis Requirement | Sovereign Stack Mechanism |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Interoperable Safety | MACH + CLTB |
| Deterministic Containment | ZEOL + Blacksite + Blackstop |
| Failure Prevention | ΔS Zones + Proxy Valve |
| Cross-Agent Alignment | Global Constraint Vector |
| Auditability | Constitutional Axioms + Stress Map |
| Refusal Behavior | Axiom A + Burn Protocol |

---

# 4. Deployment Scope (Conservative Statement)

Sovereign Stack provides a **software-governance architecture**.  
No hardware enforcement or quantum substrate claims are made.

This brief is **suitable for compliance positioning**, not as a certification claim.
