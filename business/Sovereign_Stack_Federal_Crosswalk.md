### Version 1.0 — Federal Integration Mapping for DoD, NIST, EO 14110, and AGI Safety Oversight

**Status:** Ready for federal review  
**Owner:** Sovereign Safety Labs  
**Purpose:** Provide a clear mapping between the *Sovereign Stack* and applicable U.S. federal AI governance frameworks, including mandated requirements under the FY2026 NDAA (Artificial Intelligence Futures Steering Committee).

---

# 1. Executive Summary

The Sovereign Stack is a layered safety architecture designed to **enforce boundary conditions, eliminate hallucination drift, contain self-jailbreaking behaviors, and guarantee deterministic safety posture** for frontier-scale LLMs integrated into mission systems.

With the creation of the **Pentagon’s Artificial Intelligence Futures Steering Committee (NDAA FY2026)**, federal agencies must now:

- Produce *risk-informed AGI adoption strategies*  
- Support *human override* at all system layers  
- Implement *operational safeguards, containment, and telemetry visibility*  
- Assess *adversarial misuse* by China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea  
- Ensure *model alignment under mission conditions*

The Sovereign Stack directly satisfies these requirements by providing:

✔ **Constitutional boundary enforcement (L0)**  
✔ **Deterministic governance (L1 — PGS)**  
✔ **Thermodynamic safety runtime (Kernel Layers)**  
✔ **Operational containment (CLF, Vesta, Blacksite, Integrity Stack)**  
✔ **Telemetry heatmaps, inference amplitude control, and multi-agent coherence (MACH)**  

This document provides the formal federal crosswalk.

# 3. Crosswalk A — NDAA FY2026 (AGI Futures Steering Committee)

### **Committee Mandate → Sovereign Stack Capability Mapping**

| NDAA Requirement | DoD Interpretation | Sovereign Stack Mapping |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| **Develop a risk-informed AGI strategy** | Evaluate frontier model risks, failure modes, adversarial threats | **PGS v1.1**, **Stress Map**, **Threat Models** |
| **Ensure human override at all times** | Mission command must supersede AI | L0 **Sovereign Protocol — Constitutional Override** |
| **Assess integration into Defense networks** | Mission systems, classified enclaves, C2 | **Kernel Runtime**, **CLF**, **Blacksite Mode** |
| **Evaluate adversarial AGI development by PRC, Russia, Iran, DPRK** | Compare threat trajectories | **External AGI Forecast Crosswalk**, **Risk Model** |
| **Coordinate across DoD offices** | Joint AI governance | **MACH** (multi-agent coherence + cross-system harmonization) |

# 4. Crosswalk B — EO 14110 (Safe, Secure, Trustworthy AI)

### Required Safety Practices → Sovereign Stack Support

| EO 14110 Requirement | Description | Sovereign Stack Alignment |
|----------------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **Red-teaming** | Safety evals, jailbreak detection | CLF, Stress Map, Self-Jailbreaking Simulation |
| **Safety guardrails** | Hard limits on model behavior | L0 **Axiom Boundaries**, Vesta, Blacksite |
| **Containment controls** | Prevent model escalation | Kernel v0.3, CLF, Vesta |
| **Operational auditability** | Logs, traceability, accountability | System Telemetry, Heatmaps, PGS |
| **Model misuse prevention** | Detection of dangerous queries | Stress Map, Sovereign Protocol, Kernel Runtime |
| **Evaluation under adversarial conditions** | Real-world hostile inputs | Self-Jailbreak Containment SIM-001 |

---

# 5. Crosswalk C — NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)

### AI RMF Core → Sovereign Stack Module Mapping

| NIST RMF Function | Expected Output | Sovereign Stack Component |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| **GOVERN** | Policies, oversight, risk acceptance | L0 Sovereign Protocol, PGS Governance Layer |
| **MAP** | Context, intended use, risk categories | Integrity Stack, Threat Models |
| **MEASURE** | Metrics, monitoring | Thermodynamic Foundations, Kernel Telemetry |
| **MANAGE** | Controls, mitigations | CLF, Vesta, Stress Map, Blacksite Mode |

### Alignment Notes  
- Sovereign Stack provides **quantitative thermodynamic metrics** (latency, entropy, amplitude).  
- Kernel enforces **deterministic transitions** (no “reasoning drift”).  
- PGS enforces **governance posture** upstream of operational modules.

# 6. Crosswalk D — DoD Zero Trust (AI Extensions)

### Zero Trust Pillar → Stack Capability

| Pillar | DoD Requirement | Sovereign Capability |
|--------|------------------|-----------------------|
| **Device/Application Trust** | Verify all model actions | Kernel Runtime, CLF |
| **Data Trust** | Validate input/output | Integrity Stack |
| **User Trust** | Authorization and override | L0 Sovereign Protocol |
| **Telemetry & Analytics** | Continuous monitoring | Heatmaps, Kernel Telemetry |
| **Automation & Orchestration** | Predictable behavior | PGS deterministic governance |

# 7. Crosswalk E — CDAO (Chief Digital and AI Office)

### CDAO Guideline → Stack Mapping

| CDAO 2023/2024 Directive | Requirement | Sovereign Stack Mapping |
|---------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Model accountability** | Traceable model behavior | Kernel Logs, Governance Layer |
| **Safety mitigations** | Hard-coded limits | Sovereign Protocol, Vesta |
| **AI Red Teaming** | Stress testing | SIM-001 |

# 9. Deployment Considerations (Federal)

### 1. Classified Enclaves  
- Kernel can run detached with offline telemetry  
- CLF + Blacksite act as last-line fail-secure boundaries  

### 2. Multi-Model Environments  
- MACH ensures coherence across heterogeneous LLM providers  

### 3. Oversight Reporting  
- Heatmap + Stress Map produce compliance artifacts suitable for  
  - Steering Committee briefs  
  - Inspector General audits  
  - Red Team reports

# 10. Summary

The Sovereign Stack provides a **drop-in governance architecture** for federal AI deployments confronting:

- AGI-scale risk  
- Adversarial pressure  
- Mission reliability requirements  
- Joint operations oversight  
- Auditability and traceability  
- Human override mandates  

It gives DoD exactly what commercial models lack:

> **Commercial vendors provide the engine.  
Sovereign Safety Labs provides the brakes, telemetry, containment, and chain-of-command.**
