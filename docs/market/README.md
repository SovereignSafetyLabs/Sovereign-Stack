# Market & Policy Analysis

## Scope and Purpose

This folder contains **interpretive analysis, policy mapping, and external-facing discussion documents** related to the *Vesta Governance Framework*.

Materials in this directory are intended to:
- contextualize the framework within emerging federal, defense, and policy landscapes
- explore governance implications and sequencing (e.g., runtime vs. settlement layers)
- support discussion with institutional, research, or policy stakeholders
- provide non-binding analytical perspectives on AI governance trends

These documents are **not implementation specifications**, **not operational claims**, and **not guarantees of system behavior**.

## Posture and Limitations

All contents in this directory are classified as **research analysis and conceptual mapping**.

Specifically:
- No files in this folder describe deployed systems
- No performance, security, or safety guarantees are asserted
- No commercialization, procurement, or certification claims are made
- References to timelines, adoption phases, or industry needs are **analytical hypotheses**, not commitments

Any technical mechanisms referenced here are defined elsewhere in the repository and should be evaluated independently in their respective technical contexts.
