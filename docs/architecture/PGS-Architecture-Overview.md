# PGS Architecture Overview
**Platinum Governance Suite (PGS)**  
**Document Type:** Conceptual Architecture Overview  
**Status:** Research Reference (Non-Operational)  
**Scope:** Architectural synthesis across existing framework components

## 1. Purpose

This document provides a **conceptual architectural overview** of the Platinum Governance Suite (PGS) as described across the Vesta Governance Framework.

PGS is not a standalone system or deployable product.  
It is a **structural composition** of governance components intended to:

- organize how individual modules relate to one another  
- describe layered responsibility boundaries  
- support analytical reasoning about governance behavior under stress  

No operational guarantees, deployment claims, or enforcement assurances are made.

---

## 2. Architectural Intent

PGS is organized as a **layered governance architecture**, where each layer addresses a distinct class of risk or failure mode observed in advanced reasoning systems.

The architecture reflects the following design intentions:

- separation of concerns across semantic, cognitive, causal, and temporal domains  
- progressive constraint tightening under sustained pressure  
- fail-secure escalation rather than adaptive relaxation  
- externalized governance logic rather than reliance on internal reasoning  

PGS should be understood as an **analytical framework**, not an implementation blueprint.

## 3. The Layered Structure (Conceptual)

PGS is described as a multi-layer stack, ordered from highest-level constraints to terminal containment:

- **Layer 0 — Sovereign Protocol**  
  Constitutional identity and boundary constraints.

- **Layer 1 — Integrity Stack**  
  Logical coherence, ambiguity detection, and reasoning consistency.

- **Layer 2 — Causal Link Forcing (CLF)**  
  Causal lineage validation and inference-chain integrity.

- **Layer 2.5 — Vesta Protocol**  
  Reasoning amplitude and boundary containment.

- **Layer 3 — Stress Map**  
  Temporal pressure, repetition, and escalation signaling.

- **Layer 4 — Blacksite Mode**  
  Terminal fail-secure containment state.

Each layer is conceptually independent, but structurally interdependent.

## 4. Progressive Hardening (Design Pattern)

A core architectural pattern across PGS is **progressive hardening**:

- interpretive flexibility decreases under pressure  
- reasoning amplitude narrows as stress accumulates  
- outputs become shorter, more literal, or cease entirely  
- escalation is monotonic and non-reversible within a session  

This pattern reflects an observed design approach rather than a guaranteed outcome.

## 5. What This Document Is Not

This document does **not**:

- define implementation details  
- specify thresholds, metrics, or algorithms  
- claim enforcement effectiveness  
- describe deployment environments  
- constitute a compliance framework  
- represent a commercial or operational offering  

All authoritative claims remain scoped to individual component documents.

## 6. Relationship to Other Materials

This overview synthesizes concepts defined in:

- Sovereign Protocol specifications  
- Integrity Stack documentation  
- CLF, Vesta, Stress Map, and Blacksite references  
- Kernel and thermodynamic theory materials
