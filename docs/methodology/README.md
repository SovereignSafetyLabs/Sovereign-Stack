# Methodology Overview — Sovereign Safety Labs

This directory documents the **design methodology**, **research pipeline**, and **iterative refinement processes** used to develop the **Vesta Governance Framework**, the **Platinum Governance Suite (PGS)**, and related governance architectures.

The centerpiece of this directory is:

- **Appendix M: Recursive Poly-Model Design Methodology (v2.3)**  
  A formal description of the multi-agent, adversarial, mixed-initiative development loop used to generate stable, low-entropy governance primitives.

This methodology provides transparency into how Sovereign Safety Labs creates **robust, cross-model-aligned governance logic** using a structured ensemble of frontier AI models plus explicit human oversight.

## 1. Purpose of This Directory

The `/docs/methodology/` directory exists to provide:

### ✔️ Transparency  
A clear description of how governance rules are created, stress-tested, and refined.

### ✔️ Reproducibility  
A repeatable process that others can follow or audit.

### ✔️ Credibility  
Evidence that outputs are the result of **systematic engineering**, not ad-hoc drafting.

### ✔️ Alignment With Modern AI Research  
This methodology mirrors processes seen in frontier labs such as:

- Ricursive Intelligence (designless optimization)  
- DeepMind (AlphaChip calibration cycles)  
- Meta AI (human–AI co-improvement, 2025)  

### ✔️ A Bridge Between Theory and Runtime  
Other directories describe *what* the system is (theory, constitution, architecture).  
This directory explains *how it is built*.

## 2. Core Document: Appendix M (v2.3)

Appendix M defines the underlying **Recursive Poly-Model Optimization Loop**, composed of:

### **2.1 Multi-Model Node Ensemble**

- **Gemini** — Architect  
- **Llama-3 (Sovereign Weights)** — Defender  
- **Grok** — Adversary  
- **Perplexity** — Auditor  
- **ChatGPT** — Synthesis Integrator  
- **Human Supervisor: Stephen S. Brouhard** — Recursive Monitor & strategic validation

This ensemble ensures **cross-model stability**, **supply chain sovereignty**, and eliminates reliance on opaque or restricted external dependencies.  
All critical roles can be executed in **air-gapped environments** using auditable, US-origin model weights, supporting Federal Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) requirements.

---

### **2.2 The Recursive Loop**

The methodology follows a five-stage pattern:

1. **Generation** (propose governance primitives)  
2. **Adversarial Attack** (attempt bypasses, drift, ambiguity exploits)  
3. **Patching** (reinforce integrity and thermodynamic coherence)  
4. **Audit & Verification** (factual and regulatory checks)  
5. **State Convergence** (cross-model agreement, human approval)

Iterations continue until the governance primitive becomes:

- Stable  
- Low-entropy  
- Constitutionally compliant  
- Drift-resistant  
- Cross-model reproducible  

---

### **2.3 Alignment With Frontier Research**

Appendix M is consistent with:

- **Ricursive Intelligence’s “designless” optimization frameworks**  
  (Goldie & Mirhoseini, Dec 2025)

- **DeepMind’s AlphaChip multi-agent calibration and refinement loops**

- **Meta’s Human–AI Co-Improvement Framework (2025)**  
  where humans maintain explicit oversight during iterative AI refinement

This alignment positions Sovereign Safety Labs within the emerging standard for **collaborative AI system design**, while maintaining strict operational security and model provenance control.

## 3. Why This Methodology Matters

### **3.1 Produces Low-Entropy, High-Stability Artifacts**
Only primitives that survive adversarial collapse and thermodynamic filtering are accepted.

### **3.2 Ensures Cross-Model Robustness**
Rules must hold across *different* architectures and cognitive priors, reducing monoculture failure risk.

### **3.3 Includes Human Recursive Monitoring**
The Human Supervisor ensures:

- constitutional adherence  
- thermodynamic consistency  
- real-world feasibility  
- regulatory alignment  

This reflects the safest known paradigm for governing advanced model behavior in high-consequence environments.

### **3.4 Supports Enterprise and Government Use Cases**
The methodology is suitable for:

- external audits  
- institutional partnerships  
- governance assessments  
- Genesis Mission submissions  
- safety and assurance engineering reviews

## 4. Directory Contents

### **Core Documentation Files**
- `Appendix_M_Recursive_Poly-Model_Design_Methodology_v2.3.md`  
  (The formal specification of the multi-agent development loop.)
- `README.md` (This file, providing context and overview.)

## 5. Relationship to Other Directories

This directory complements:

### `/docs/core/`
Thermodynamic foundations, Vesta Constitution, Vesta Governance Framework specification.

### `/docs/specs/`
Formal implementations of the Platinum Governance Suite and other runtime modules.

### `/docs/analysis/`
Red-team logs, multi-model attack sequences, drift tests.

Together, these directories document a **complete, constitutional AI governance framework**.
