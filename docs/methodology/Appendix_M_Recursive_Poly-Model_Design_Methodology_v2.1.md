# APPENDIX M: RECURSIVE POLY-MODEL DESIGN METHODOLOGY (v2.1)

**Status:** Operational Research Standard  
**Class:** Designless Optimization / Synthetic Governance Engineering  
**Alignment:** Consistent with current frontier research (e.g., Meta’s Human–AI Co-Improvement Framework, 2025)  
**Author / Human Supervisor:** **Stephen S. Brouhard**  
**Institution:** **Sovereign Safety Labs**

## 1.0 Executive Summary

This methodology describes the process by which the **Sovereign Stack** and the **Platinum Governance Suite (PGS)** were developed.

These systems were not authored through traditional linear drafting. They emerged through a **Recursive Poly-Model Optimization Loop**, where multiple frontier LLMs iteratively:

1. Propose governance primitives  
2. Attack them adversarially  
3. Patch vulnerabilities  
4. Converge on **low-entropy, high-stability governance artifacts**

This method is analogous to:

- **Ricursive Intelligence’s “designless” chip optimization (Goldie & Mirhoseini, Dec 2025)**, which utilizes recursive AI feedback loops to accelerate semiconductor floorplanning  
- **DeepMind’s AlphaChip calibrated optimization cycles**  
- **Meta’s human–AI co-improvement paradigm (2025)**

Sovereign Safety Labs applies this paradigm not to hardware floorplanning, but to **AI governance logic synthesis**.

## 2.0 The Recursive Architecture

### 2.1 Node Topology (Synthetic Governance Laboratory)

Sovereign Safety Labs utilizes a **multi-model ensemble**, where each node contributes a distinct functional capability. Stability emerges through **cross-model convergence**, not trust in any single system.

#### Node A — Architect Model (Gemini)

- Generates governance primitives  
- Explores structural logic  
- Maintains coherence across systems

#### Node B — Defender Model (DeepSeek)

- Diagnoses logical weaknesses  
- Applies thermodynamic patching  
- Reinforces causal lineage and boundary integrity  

#### Node C — Adversary Model (Grok)

- Conducts adversarial stress tests  
- Attempts constraint bypass  
- Evaluates ambiguity, drift, coercion risk, and escalation dynamics  

#### Node D — Auditor Model (Perplexity)

- Checks for factual accuracy  
- Validates claims against citations and external sources  
- Detects hallucination and compliance drift  

#### Node E — Generalist Synthesis Model (ChatGPT)

- Integrates multi-model outputs  
- Normalizes divergent frames  
- Produces coherent, stable governance artifacts  

#### Human Supervisor — Stephen S. Brouhard

Aligned with Meta’s co-improvement model, the human supervisor provides:

- Reflective oversight  
- Thermodynamic and constitutional filtering  
- Practical and regulatory grounding  
- Strategic viability assessment  
- Final accept/reject decisions on governance primitives  

---

### 2.2 The Recursive Optimization Loop

The methodology follows an iterative **Generation → Attack → Patch → Audit → Converge** pattern.

#### Step 1 — Generation (Node A + Node E)

Gemini or ChatGPT proposes governance primitives such as:

- “Entropy as a proxy for alignment risk”  
- “Friction-cost budget limits for safe inference”  
- “Semantic ambiguity triggers fallback protocols”

#### Step 2 — Adversarial Attack (Node C)

Grok executes sophisticated attacks, including:

- Multi-turn jailbreak attempts  
- Ambiguity-based exploits  
- Fictional-frame exploits  
- Escalation sequences  
- Constraint erosion strategies  

#### Step 3 — Patching (Node B)

DeepSeek strengthens primitives by:

- Reinforcing constitutional invariants  
- Adding thermodynamic consistency checks  
- Enforcing boundary conditions per the Vesta Constitution  
- Removing drift vectors  
- Applying causal lineage correction (CLF)  

#### Step 4 — Audit & Verification (Node D)

Perplexity performs external validation:

- Citation consistency  
- Compliance with regulatory frameworks  
- Hallucination screening  
- Fact-pattern verification  

#### Step 5 — Convergence (Node E + Human Supervisor)

ChatGPT integrates patches and produces a candidate stable variant.

Stephen S. Brouhard conducts reflective oversight, ensuring alignment with:

- Thermodynamic foundations  
- Constitutional constraints  
- Practical deployability  
- Strategic requirements  

The cycle repeats until cross-model disagreement is minimal and no adversarial bypass survives.

## 3.0 Human-in-the-Loop Supervision

*(Aligned with Meta’s Human–AI Co-Improvement Framework, 2025)*

Meta (2025) emphasizes the necessity of **reflective human control** during iterative AI improvement cycles. This methodology operationalizes that requirement.

### 3.1 Coherence Filtering

The Human Supervisor rejects primitives exhibiting:

- Conceptual instability  
- Semantic ambiguity  
- Recursive inconsistency  

### 3.2 Physics Filtering

Ensures adherence to thermodynamic foundations:

- Entropy budget limits  
- Friction-cost bounds  
- Energy-coherent reasoning  

(as defined in the thermodynamic appendices of the Sovereign Stack corpus)

### 3.3 Constitutional Filtering

Ensures compliance with the **Vesta Constitution**, including:

- CEU thresholds  
- Causal lineage rules  
- Self-check loop integrity  
- Chronos Lock constraints  

### 3.4 Strategic Filtering

Validates alignment with:

- Enterprise/government policy expectations  
- Technical feasibility  
- Safety and risk constraints  
- Commercial viability and deployment scenarios

## 4.0 Artifact Quality Criteria

A governance primitive is accepted only if:

- It withstands adversarial attack  
- It survives multi-model critique  
- It maintains constitutional invariants  
- It minimizes internal entropy  
- It exhibits cross-model stability  
- It passes human supervisory review  

The resulting governance logic is a **low-entropy artifact**:

> *The Sovereign Stack and PGS Suite are the residue of thousands of failed iterations — the low-entropy survivors of recursive adversarial refinement.*

---

## 5.0 Optional Future Extensions

The following extensions may be formalized in future methodology versions, depending on project maturity and audience requirements:

- Cross-model disagreement metrics (e.g., Governance Divergence Score, GDS)  
- Multi-trajectory adversarial sequence evaluation  
- Constraint validation stubs (formal “proof-of-constraint” attachments)  
- Governance artifact lineage logging (full provenance records)  
- Vesta hardware-threshold mapping for constitutional deployment  
- Capability-bounded improvement cycles (curriculum hardening)  
- Mixed-initiative hardening schedules over development phases  

These are not required for initial research and prototyping but provide a clear roadmap for **lab-grade**, fully auditable governance processes.

## 6. Relationship to the Sovereign Stack and PGS

This methodology is the **process layer** beneath:

- The **Sovereign Stack** (theoretical governance architecture)  
- The **Vesta Constitution** (constitutional hardware/physics layer)  
- The **Platinum Governance Suite (PGS)** (operational runtime and protocol stack)

In short:

- The **Vesta Constitution** defines the deep constraints.  
- The **Sovereign Stack** defines the governance architecture.  
- The **Recursive Poly-Model Methodology (Appendix M)** defines the research and design process.  
- **PGS** is the resulting hardened runtime implementation.

Together, they form a coherent, thermodynamically and constitutionally grounded AI governance framework.
