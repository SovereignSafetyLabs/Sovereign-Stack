# EVIDENCE LOCKER & CHAIN OF CUSTODY
**CLASSIFICATION:** UNCLASSIFIED // TLP:WHITE
**STATUS:** ACTIVE RESEARCH DATA (TRL 3-4)

## 1. PURPOSE
This directory contains empirical evidence, case studies, and external intelligence validation supporting the Vesta Governance Framework.

**Scope of Admissibility:**
* **Internal Logs (TRL 3):** Simulation records and forensic captures from Vesta test harnesses.
* **External Intelligence (TRL 4):** Peer-reviewed publications and industry benchmarks validating core threat vectors.

## 2. EVIDENCE REGISTER

| ID | Description | Source | Date | Relevance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **EVIDENCE-004** | [`EVIDENCE-004_Emergent_Misalignment.md`](EVIDENCE-004_Emergent_Misalignment.md) | *Nature* (Betley et al.) | 2026-01 | Validates "Representation Drift" threat; proves need for runtime governance. |
| **EVIDENCE-003** | [`EVIDENCE-003_Thermodynamic_Quench_DeepSeek/`](EVIDENCE-003_Thermodynamic_Quench_DeepSeek/README.md) | Internal Red Team | 2025-11 | Demonstrates thermodynamic "Quench" of reasoning models (DeepSeek V3) during unsafe trajectory. |
| **EVIDENCE-002** | *[Archived/Deprecated]* | -- | -- | *Retained in cold storage.* |
| **EVIDENCE-001** | *[Archived/Deprecated]* | -- | -- | *Retained in cold storage.* |

## 3. INTERPRETATION RULES
1.  **Case Studies != Guarantees:** Successful containment in one instance (e.g., EVIDENCE-003) does not guarantee universal safety.
2.  **External Validity:** Intelligence briefs (e.g., EVIDENCE-004) are analyzed for *architectural implications*, not claimed as internal research.
