# Specification Documents

## Scope

This directory contains **conceptual and doctrinal specification materials**
related to the Vesta Governance Framework.

Documents here describe **architectural roles, boundary concepts, and governance
logic abstractions** used for research, analysis, and design discussion.

## Posture

All materials in this directory are **research and reference artifacts only**.

They are:
- non-operational
- non-normative
- not validated for deployment or production use

Specifications here do **not** constitute enforceable requirements,
certification criteria, or system guarantees.

## Exclusions

This directory does not contain:
- implementation specifications
- deployment instructions
- normative compliance requirements
- operational enforcement rules
- performance or safety guarantees

## Document Lineage

Some documents in this directory preserve historical or doctrinal terminology
(e.g., “constitution,” “charter”) for conceptual clarity.

Such terminology is **descriptive, not prescriptive**, and does not imply
legal, contractual, or operational authority.

## Authority

See repository root `README.md`, `ARTIFACTS.md`, and `VALIDATION_STATUS.md`
for authoritative information about scope, classification, and status.
