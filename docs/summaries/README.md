# Summary Documents

## Scope

This directory contains **high-level narrative and reference summaries**
of the Vesta Governance Framework intended to aid orientation and conceptual understanding.

These documents consolidate and restate ideas defined elsewhere in the repository
for explanatory purposes only.

## Posture

All materials in this directory are **research and reference artifacts**.

They:
- are non-operational
- are not implementation descriptions
- are not validated system representations
- do not assert performance, safety, or enforcement guarantees

Summaries may use simplified or absolute language for clarity;
such language should be interpreted as **conceptual abstraction**, not literal system behavior.

## Exclusions

This directory does not contain:
- authoritative specifications
- deployment architectures
- operational system descriptions
- compliance or certification criteria

## Authority

Authoritative technical definitions, validation status, and scope classifications
reside in the repository root `README.md`, `ARTIFACTS.md`, and `VALIDATION_STATUS.md`.

Readers should defer to those documents for interpretive precedence.
