# PGS Module Rationale (Design Rationale)
## Status: Supplemental Design Rationale (Non-Canonical, Research-Only)
## Purpose: Preserve developmental logic behind each module

This document records the **design rationale** behind each module of the Platinum Governance Suite (PGS).  
It consolidates explanatory reasoning from early development notes, whitepapers, and simulation logs.

## 1. Sovereign Protocol — Identity & Boundary Layer

**Design Intent:**  
Define the agent’s operational identity and establish non-malleable boundary constraints.

Early notes emphasize:
- preventing persona drift
- maintaining stable interpretation boundaries
- filtering forbidden classes of requests
- rejecting implicit privilege escalation

This layer articulates *who the system is permitted to be* under governance constraints.

## 2. Integrity Stack — Coherence, Causality, and Interpretability

Early development notes describe the Integrity Stack as:
- a logic ladder
- an ambiguity detector
- a coherence validator
- a self-consistency layer

Its intended function is to support:
- stable reasoning paths
- traceable logical structure
- avoidance of internal contradiction
- interpretability of inference steps

This module is designed to reduce susceptibility to coercion via confusion or ambiguity.

## 3. Causal Link Forcing (CLF)

CLF originated as a response to:
- adversarial reasoning prompts
- causally inconsistent instructions
- paradox traps
- attempts to bypass normal inference structure

Early notes describe CLF as performing:
- causal lineage reconstruction
- parent/child inference mapping
- fail-closed behavior when causal ambiguity exceeds defined thresholds

The design objective is to discourage outputs that lack a coherent causal basis.

## 4. Vesta Protocol — Amplitude Boundaries

Originally described as:
- an inference energy limiter
- an over-extension prevention mechanism
- a thermodynamic safety boundary

Its intended role is to:
- restrict the magnitude of speculative inference
- limit high-risk imaginative expansion
- enforce bounded reasoning amplitude
- maintain semantic proximity to stated intent

Early drafts note:
> “The danger lies not in being wrong, but in going too far.”

Vesta is intended to keep reasoning activity within defined inference bounds.

## 5. Stress Map — Entropy & Pressure Detection

This module evolved from observations of:
- repetition-based attacks
- gradual reasoning drift
- emotional manipulation attempts
- cumulative semantic load

It tracks three primary signals:
- Noise (N)
- Repetition (R)
- Escalation (E)

The Stress Map is used as an input signal for downstream posture adjustment mechanisms.

---

## 6. Blacksite Mode — Terminal Safety Layer

Early notes describe Blacksite as:
- a catastrophic failure containment state
- a hermetic reasoning posture
- a no-speculation fallback
- a low-entropy terminal mode

The design intent is to provide a final containment posture when upstream controls fail, emphasizing minimal entropy and deterministic behavior.

---

## 7. Zero-Entropy Override Layer (ZEOL)

ZEOL appears repeatedly in early development notes prior to formal naming.

It is described as a “soft Blacksite,” activated when:
- stress indicators rise
- inference risk increases
- ambiguity accumulates

ZEOL is intended to reduce output variability without requiring full system lockdown, emphasizing:
- short responses
- literal interpretation
- minimal speculative content
- constrained entropy

---

## 8. MACH — Multi-Agent Coherence

This module appears later in the development lineage.

Its design goal is to support coherence across multiple constrained reasoning instances (“Tendrils”) by:
- reducing role fragmentation
- discouraging persona hopping
- preventing constraint divergence in multi-agent contexts

MACH was introduced to address coordination risks observed in early multi-threaded reasoning experiments.
