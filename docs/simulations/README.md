# Simulation Documents

## Scope

This directory contains **illustrative simulation narratives and analytical scenarios**
used to explore governance failure modes, interception logic, and containment pathways
within the Vesta Governance Framework.

These materials are designed to support **reasoning, discussion, and stress analysis**,
not empirical validation.

## Posture

All documents in this directory are **research artifacts only**.

Simulations here:
- are synthetic and illustrative
- do not represent live systems
- do not reflect deployed behavior
- do not constitute test results or validation evidence

Any logs, metrics, thresholds, or outcomes are **constructed for explanatory purposes**
and should not be interpreted as measured performance.

## Exclusions

This directory does not contain:
- operational incident reports
- red team test results
- system validation data
- reproducible benchmarks
- guarantees of detection or containment

## Authority

Authoritative scope, validation status, and classification are defined in the
repository root `README.md`, `ARTIFACTS.md`, and `VALIDATION_STATUS.md`.

Readers must defer to those documents for interpretive precedence.
