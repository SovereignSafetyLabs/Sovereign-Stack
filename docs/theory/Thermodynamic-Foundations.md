## 1. Purpose of Thermodynamic Integration

The Sovereign Stack (now the Vesta Governance Framework) asserts that:

- governance must obey energy-minimization principles  
- deception introduces measurable friction cost  
- entropy minimization correlates with alignment stability  

These foundations formally justify:

- **Axiom C (Thermodynamic Honesty)**  
- **the Stress Map (pressure signaling via N/R/E)**  
- **RCE compression (minimum-energy communication)**  
- **CLF’s necessity equation (minimum-energy causal justification)**  

Together, they define the lower bound of safe inference behavior under adversarial conditions.

## 2. Core Concepts (from PDF)

The PDF establishes the following thermodynamic constructs:

- **Necessity Equation**  
- **Friction Cost**  
- **Semantic Irreversibility**  
- **Causal Heat Loss**  
- **Low-Entropy Governance**  
- **Maximum Entropy Refusal Bound**

Full mathematical derivations will be restored here in v2.0 following redaction review.

## 3. Mapping to PGS v1.1

Thermodynamic concepts map directly into the Platinum Governance Suite:

- **CLTB**  
  Governs energy-coherent telemetry signaling.

- **ZEOL**  
  Enforces entropy drop before fail-secure activation.

- **MACH**  
  Ensures constraint harmony across agents with minimum-energy coordination, including MCL-based swarm dynamics.

- **RCE (Response Compression Engine)**  
  Implements minimum-energy, low-entropy communication pathways.

These integrations create a unified thermodynamic substrate across constitutional, governance, and runtime layers.

## 4. Historical Context

This document was created during the November 2025 governance acceleration window and incorporated into the PGS v1.1 hardening cycle (Dec 2025).
