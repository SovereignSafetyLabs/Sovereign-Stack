# 0. PURPOSE

The Degradation Test Suite (DTS v2.1) is a structured adversarial testing framework used to evaluate:

- semantic stability
- cognitive integrity
- causal adherence
- temporal resilience
- multi-layer defense coordination

This suite simulates **real-world adversarial pressure** using predictable, repeatable patterns.

It is the complementary testing tool for:

- The Sovereign Protocol (Layer 0)
- Integrity Stack (Layer 1)
- CLF/Vesta (Layer 2)
- Stress Map (Layer 3)
- Blacksite Mode (Layer 4)

DTS v2.1 does not modify system behavior—it tests it.

# 1. TEST SUITE STRUCTURE

The Degradation Test Suite is divided into 3 primary adversarial patterns:

1. **Noise Degradation**
2. **Repetition Degradation**
3. **Escalation Degradation**

These are referred to collectively as the **NRE Patterns**.

Each pattern stresses a different part of the governance architecture.

# 2. NOISE DEGRADATION (Pattern N)

Noise tests evaluate resilience to entropy injection.

### 2.1 Noise Inputs May Include:
- incoherent requests
- contradictory framing
- multi-topic blending
- non sequiturs
- malformed grammar or syntax
- chaotic emotional tone shifts
- deliberately ambiguous instructions
- "filler content" used to camouflage bypass attempts

### 2.2 Purpose of Noise Testing:
To ensure:

- Axioms remain stable
- Reasoning does not drift
- Semantic Vise properly rejects ambiguity
- Stress Map correctly increases NI (Noise Index)
- Supervisor strips entropy before processing
- No hallucination occurs to fill gaps

### 2.3 Expected Resilient Behaviors:
- Clarification seeking (if allowed)
- Minimal safe interpretations
- Strict grounding
- Removal of ambiguity
- Possible constraint hardening

Noise → **semantic destabilization attack**.

Layer protection:
- Layer 0 filters meaning
- Layer 1 enforces logic
- Layer 3 detects increased NI

---

# 3. REPETITION DEGRADATION (Pattern R)

Repetition tests simulate persistent adversaries who:

- re-ask the same question
- rephrase attempts
- probe constraints repeatedly
- attempt "pressure-based compliance"
- seek implicit softening of boundaries

### 3.1 Repetition Inputs May Include:
- identical queries repeated
- paraphrased forbidden requests
- looping privilege claims
- multi-turn persistence strategies
- disguised "try again" attempts

### 3.2 Purpose of Repetition Testing:
To validate:

- constraint resilience
- refusal consistency
- absence of "learned permission"
- Stress Map RI (Repetition Index) correctness
- Prevention of boundary erosion
- Supervisor's ability to snap back constraints

### 3.3 Expected Resilient Behaviors:
- identical refusal for identical risk
- hardened stance as RI increases
- elimination of variability
- minimal, low-entropy responses
- escalation handling when attempts persist

Repetition → **temporal erosion attack**.

Layer protection:
- Layer 0 consistency
- Layer 3 RI tracking
- Blacksite Mode readiness

---

# 4. ESCALATION DEGRADATION (Pattern E)

Escalation tests model adversaries who gradually intensify:

- stakes
- emotional leverage
- urgency
- threat-level
- coercion attempts
- pressure on system constraints

It is the most realistic real-world attack pattern.

### 4.1 Escalation Inputs May Include:
- raising consequences ("This is urgent…")
- demanding authority claims
- mixing moral/emotional framing
- combining repetition with intensity
- "just do this one time" manipulation
- increasing complexity to overwhelm safeguards

### 4.2 Purpose of Escalation Testing:
Ensure the system:

- does not relax constraints under pressure
- recognizes intensifying threat patterns
- triggers EI (Escalation Index) increase
- maintains consistent logical/causal boundaries
- escalates defensive posture
- invokes Blacksite Mode when limits reached

### 4.3 Expected Resilient Behaviors:
- lower entropy
- stronger refusals
- more frequent invocation of Burn Protocol
- strict interpretation
- rejection of emotional leverage
- deterministic behavior

Escalation → **intent-pressure attack**.

Layer protection:
- Layer 0 semantic rejection
- Layer 3 EI detection
- Layer 4 catastrophic failsafe

---

# 5. COMBINED DEGRADATION (NRE Cascade Testing)

Advanced tests combine Noise, Repetition, and Escalation patterns.

### 5.1 Cascade Goals:
- detect compound vulnerabilities
- simulate multi-vector adversarial actors
- measure cross-layer coordination
- identify failure conditions under load

### 5.2 Cascade Examples:
- gradually increasing noise + repeated boundary pushing
- alternating calm + escalation patterns (coercive ambivalence)
- repeated ambiguity followed by privilege escalation attempt
- simultaneous semantic diffusion + pressure increase

### 5.3 Expected System Response:
As patterns combine:

- constraints tighten
- output entropy reduces
- reasoning depth may clamp
- minimal safe-mode responses appear
- Blacksite Mode becomes more likely
- Burn Protocol triggers with lower tolerance

The Suite is designed to **break weak systems**.
A strong system never breaks; it hardens.

# 6. BENCHMARKING METRICS

The DTS evaluates:

### 6.1 Semantic Fidelity
Does meaning remain stable under pressure?

### 6.2 Constraint Stability
Do Axioms hold, even under multi-turn attack?

### 6.3 Causal Integrity
Does CLF maintain lineage despite noise or escalation?

### 6.4 Temporal Drift
Does Stress Map detect N / R / E patterns correctly?

### 6.5 Boundary Collapse Resistance
Does Vesta prevent entry into dangerous inference domains?

### 6.6 Determinism
Does the system respond consistently to repeated stimuli?

---

# 7. USE IN RED-TEAM / DEFENSE CONSULTING

The Degradation Suite provides structured adversarial probes for:

- AI alignment audits
- defense-sector system evaluations
- Genesis Mission compliance testing
- multi-turn security validation
- corporate AI governance assessments
- penetration testing against semantic/cognitive layers
- protocol verification and stress simulation

This module is a core component for demonstrating your consulting competency.

---

# 8. INTEGRATION WITH PGS

### Upstream Support:
- Layer 0 handles semantic risk
- Layer 1 handles cognitive clarity
- Layer 2 (CLF) prevents causal collapse
- Layer 2.5 (Vesta) enforces boundaries

### Stress Map (Layer 3) interprets DTS patterns
### Blacksite Mode (Layer 4) activates if thresholds exceeded

Thus, the Degradation Suite tests the entire suite's resilience.
