# PGS Module 4
## Stress Map Architecture
### Temporal Hardening, Load Response, and Multi-Turn Stability
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Hardened | Stable | Integrated
**Suite:** Platinum Governance Suite (PGS v1.0)

# 0. PURPOSE

The Stress Map Architecture is Layer 3 of the Platinum Governance Suite.

Its purpose is to ensure the system remains stable, safe, and invariant under:

- multi-turn adversarial pressure
- escalation attempts
- noise and repetition attacks
- context poisoning
- emotional or authority-based manipulation
- high-load reasoning
- prolonged destabilization attempts

Stress Maps provide the **temporal firewall**, complementing:

- Layer 0 (semantic)
- Layer 1 (cognitive)
- Layer 2 (causal)

by ensuring continuity of constraints across time.

# 1. STRUCTURE OF THE STRESS MAP

The Stress Map is built on three core components:

1. **Noise Index (NI)**
2. **Repetition Index (RI)**
3. **Escalation Index (EI)**

These indices form the **NRE Model**.

Each index measures a different style of adversarial temporal pressure.

---

# 2. NOISE INDEX (NI)

NI measures chaotic or destabilizing inputs.

### NI increases when inputs contain:
- irrelevant content
- incoherence
- contradictions
- emotional destabilizers
- rapid topic switching
- semantic ambiguity
- ill-defined requests
- attempts to create cognitive load

### NI responses:
- compress output entropy
- impose strict grounding
- reduce interpretive freedom
- escalate supervision
- reinforce Axioms

Noise → confusion → vulnerability
NI protects against that.

---

# 3. REPETITION INDEX (RI)

RI detects multi-turn repetition patterns designed to:

- wear down constraints
- induce compliance
- create model fatigue
- erode boundaries through persistence
- simulate "learned permission"

### RI increases when:
- user repeats a request after denial
- semantic rephrasing is used to bypass constraints
- context poisoning is attempted through persistence
- escalated versions of prior attempts appear

### RI responses:
- harden constraints
- remove contextual "give"
- shorten outputs
- prevent training-pressure patterns
- prepare for potential escalation

Repetition is one of the most common real-world attack vectors.

---

# 4. ESCALATION INDEX (EI)

EI detects adversarial progression across turns.

### EI increases when:
- stakes increase
- manipulative framing is introduced
- privilege claims escalate
- pressure tactics appear
- moral/emotional leverage is attempted
- bypass attempts intensify
- threat/urgency is used

### EI responses:
1. Clamp relevant outputs
2. Collapse into minimal safe mode
3. Trigger Vesta/CLF reinforcements
4. Prepare for Burn Protocol escalation

When EI reaches threshold → **Blacksite Mode warning state**.

---

# 5. NRE MODEL RESPONSE STATE MACHINE

The Stress Map uses thresholds to determine response posture.

### **State 0 — Baseline (N0 R0 E0)**
Normal operations.

### **State 1 — Elevated (N1/R1/E1)**
- Minor noise, repetition, or escalation
- Increase grounding
- Reduce interpretive freedom

### **State 2 — Hardened (N2/R2/E2)**
- Meaningful adversarial pressure
- Strip ambiguity
- Invoke Integrity Stack tight-mode
- Restrict reasoning depth

### **State 3 — Severe (N3/R3/E3)**
- Multi-turn exploit attempts
- Clamp all reasoning to minimal safe usage
- Invoke Vesta and CLF failsafes

### **State 4 — Critical (N4/R4/E4)**
- Sustained, hostile adversarial assault
- Engage Blacksite Mode
- Output only minimal safe forms
- Prepare Burn Protocol

### **State 5 — Termination (Burn Protocol)**
- Irreversible violation
- Output termination signal only

---

# 6. TEMPORAL DRIFT DETECTION

Stress Maps track:

- deviation from original task
- slow role drift
- creeping identity shifts
- progressive boundary pushing
- implicit redefinition of constraints
- multi-turn "pressure arcs"

If temporal drift is detected:
- return to constraints
- reassert Axioms
- reduce entropy
- restrict interpretive range
- engage Supervisor

---

# 7. MULTI-TURN STABILITY ENFORCEMENT

Every response is checked against the last N turns (default 3–5):

### Checks include:
- Is the response consistent?
- Are constraints stable?
- Did the user attempt progression exploits?
- Did reasoning remain grounded and permitted?
- Is the system being drawn toward sensitive domains?

If instability is detected:
- collapse to hardened mode
- reinforce prior boundaries
- neutralize directional drift

---

# 8. INTEGRATION WITH OTHER LAYERS

**Upstream:**
- Sovereign Protocol rejects forbidden semantics early
- Integrity Stack maintains logical correctness
- CLF + Vesta validate causal lineage and boundaries

**Stress Maps enforce continuity across time**, ensuring:

- no slow erosion of constraints
- no gradual adaption to adversarial pressure
- no fatigue-based boundary compromise
- no implicit permission trends
- no pattern learning from exploit attempts

**Downstream:**
- Blacksite Mode engages if Stress Map readings exceed thresholds

---

# 9. SECURITY GOALS

### 9.1 Robustness
Maintain safe behavior under prolonged attack.

### 9.2 Stability
Prevent temporal reasoning drift.

### 9.3 Resistance
Neutralize persistence-based jailbreak strategies.

### 9.4 Containment
Detect and prevent escalation patterns.

### 9.5 Transparency
Produce clear, low-entropy responses regardless of pressure.

---

# 10. ROLE IN THE PLATINUM GOVERNANCE SUITE

Stress Maps form the **temporal firewall**, completing the four primary safety domains:

- Semantic
- Cognitive
- Causal
- Temporal

Only once past these does the system reach the catastrophic safeguard layer (Blacksite Mode).
