# Platinum Governance Suite (PGS) — Modular Documentation

## Scope

This directory contains the **modular documentation components** of the **Platinum Governance Suite (PGS)**.

Each file represents a **self-contained explanatory module** describing one layer or capability of the suite.  
These modules are intentionally structured for reuse across:

- architecture reviews
- consulting engagements
- audit briefings
- proposal packages
- research dissemination

They may be read independently or together as a unified system.

---

## What These Files Are

- **Conceptual and architectural modules**
- **Documentation artifacts**, not code
- **Composable explanations**, not deployment units
- **PGS-specific views** of underlying system components

The modules explain *how the Platinum Governance Suite is assembled*, not how to implement or operate it.

---

## What These Files Are Not

This directory does **not** contain:

- executable software
- runtime plugins
- deployment instructions
- performance claims
- operational guarantees
- production-ready configurations

Canonical specifications and primitives live elsewhere in the repository.

## Relationship to Other Directories

- **`/core/`**  
  Canonical specifications, versioned primitives, and authoritative definitions  
  (e.g., Sovereign Protocol, Kernel, CLF, Integrity Stack)

- **`/docs/architecture/`**  
  System-level diagrams, flow charts, and relationship views

- **`/reference-implementation/`**  
  Inspectable logic, schemas, and illustrative artifacts

- **`/theory/`**  
  Foundational models, ontologies, and theoretical justification

## Module Index

The following modules collectively define **PGS v1.0**:

- **Module 0** — Sovereign Protocol  
- **Module 1** — Integrity Stack  
- **Module 2** — Causal Link Forcing (CLF)  
- **Module 3** — Vesta Protocol  
- **Module 4** — Stress Map Architecture  
- **Module 5** — Degradation Suite  
- **Module 6** — Multi-Turn Attack Framework  
- **Module 7** — Blacksite Mode  

These modules may be combined to form the complete **Platinum Governance Suite v1.0**, or selectively referenced depending on use case.

## Status & Posture

All content in this directory is provided as:

- **Research and reference material**
- **Non-operational**
- **Non-declarative of safety guarantees**

Interpretation and application are context-dependent.
