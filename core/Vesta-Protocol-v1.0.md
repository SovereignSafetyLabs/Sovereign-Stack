# Vesta Protocol

**Version 1.0 — Boundary & Amplitude Enforcement (Layer 2.5)**

The Vesta Protocol governs inference amplitude, semantic boundary cohesion, and controlled containment behavior within the Vesta Governance Framework.  
Vesta operates as **Layer 2.5**, mediating between semantic governance (PGS) and thermodynamic enforcement (Kernel v0.3).

## 1. FUNCTIONS

### **Boundary Enforcement**
Prevents:

- extrapolation beyond validated context  
- unsafe or novel inference chains  
- causal drift originating from user-supplied assumptions  
- boundary-crossing trajectories detected by CLF  

Boundary enforcement ensures that all reasoning remains within permitted semantic width.

---

### **Amplitude Limiting**
Controls reasoning depth and complexity under load.

- applies amplitude ceilings during N/R/E escalation  
- narrows semantic width before thermodynamic clamps activate  
- reduces hypothesis generation in ambiguous or adversarial states  

This is the **soft-clamp layer** before ZEOL or Kernel ΔS enforcement.

---

### **Containment Modes**

- **Normal** — full semantic amplitude  
- **Reduced Amplitude** — constrained reasoning width  
- **ZEOL** — literal-only mode, minimal entropy, no hypotheticals  
- **Blacksite** — fail-secure containment; irreversible boundary clamp  

These modes define Vesta’s boundary response ladder.

## 2. PGS v1.1 SYNC

Vesta v1.0 integrates tightly with PGS v1.1:

- **CLTB telemetry ingestion**  
  Vesta reads N/R/E pressure and adjusts amplitude ceilings accordingly.

- **Amplitude scaling with Stress Map load**  
  Boundary narrowing begins before Kernel ΔS enforcement triggers.

- **Unified Containment Ladder**  
  Vesta anchors Layer 2.5 in the PGS hardening path:
  Normal → Reduced Amplitude → ZEOL → Blackstop.

Vesta is the **intermediate boundary regulator** used to prevent semantic expansion before thermodynamic enforcement.
