# Sovereign Kernel
## Version 0.1 — Conceptual Specification

This file serves as the placeholder for the runtime kernel sitting atop PGS v1.1.
It will define:

- initialization sequence  
- module loading order  
- telemetry fan-in  
- cross-layer arbitration  
- deterministic output renderer  
- kernel-level invariants  

This document will be expanded in Section 4.
